repeat for disks and rb:

- run compression sweep, measuring P, T, U, Ov, phi, pos, (angle)
- calculate msd (msad) and g(r)
- show convergence of results (accounting for dynamic scaling with t sqrt(T))
- repeat for G(t) using shorter runs stemming from the end of each compression increment (ALSO USE TO CALCULATE SHORT TIME MSD, MSAD)

Later:

- calculate mu
- calculate contacts
